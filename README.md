# AI Yuumi Bot for League of Legends

## Overview

This project implements an AI-powered Yuumi Bot for League of Legends, designed to automate certain aspects of playing Yuumi, the Magical Cat, in the game. Yuumi is a support champion known for her ability to attach to allies and enhance their abilities. The AI bot is built to assist players in executing Yuumi's skills and making strategic decisions during the game.

## Features

- **Automated Skill Execution:** The bot can automatically cast Yuumi's abilities, such as Q - Prowling Projectile, W - You and Me!, E - Zoomies, and R - Final Chapter, based on game events and conditions.

- **Decision-Making:** The bot employs decision-making algorithms to determine the optimal times to use Yuumi's skills, including healing allies, engaging enemies, and using ultimate abilities.

- **Game Awareness:** The bot uses computer vision and game API integration to be aware of the in-game state, including ally and enemy positions, health status, and other relevant information.

- ~~**Customization:** The bot is customizable, allowing users to configure its behavior, skill priorities, and other settings to suit their playstyle.~~
